The music swelled, surrounding him, permeating him, picking him up in a great hand and sweeping him into new and strange and beautiful worlds--worlds of tall metal structures, of vast stretches of greenness and of water and of trees and of small pale creatures that flew giant metal insects. He dreamed of these things which his planet Mars had not known for millions of years. After a while, the music stopped, but for a moment neither of them said anything. At last Channeljumper sighed. "It's beautiful," he said. "Yes," Longtree admitted. "But--" Channeljumper seemed puzzled--"but somehow it doesn't seem complete. Almost, but not quite. As though--as though--" Longtree sighed. "One more note would do it. One more note--no more, no less--at the end of the crescendo could tie the symphony together and end it. But which one? I've tried them all, and none of them fit!" His voice had risen higher in his excitement, and Channeljumper warned, "Careful, you're beginning to turn purple." "I know," Longtree said mournfully, and the purple tint changed to a more acceptable green. "But I've got to win first prize at the festival tomorrow; Redsand promised to marry me if I did." "You can't lose," Channeljumper told him, and then remembered, "if you can get that last note." "If," Longtree echoed despairingly, as though his friend had asked the impossible.
