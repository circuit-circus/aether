"I cannot," he said staunchly. "My place is with you, especially on an alien ship." "I'm not at risk, Micah. I'll be with Captain Serrado. Take a moment for yourself; you won't get one like it for some time to come." "Colonel Micah, she's perfectly safe here. But even if she weren't, I assure you that I would defend her with my life." "Me too," Lhyn said, which made both Tal and Micah smile. "You're sure?" he asked. "I'm sure." Besides, his true wish was as clear as a summer sky. She would not have him standing in a windowless corridor, guarding a closed door, when he could sit here and enjoy such a view. He acquiesced, which spoke to the strength of his desires, and Ekatya led them out of the lounge. They walked down an unremarkable corridor, into a magnetic lift, and down an equally unremarkable corridor to a door that looked like any other. After confirming Ekatya's voice command with the ship's system, the door slid open. "It's not a suite in the State House, but they're the nicest quarters on the ship other than the captain's," she said as they entered the utilitarian room. Tal thought it was pleasant enough, though decorated far too blandly for her tastes. But it was an outside suite with actual windows, and that alone made it prime real estate. She found the placement of the sofa baffling, however: under the windows and facing inward, not outward. If she had these quarters, flipping that around would be the first thing on her agenda. How could anyone sit here and not look out? "Andira," Lhyn said, "we didn't really ask you here to see our quarters." That got her full attention, and when she focused on their emotions, she knew. "One last Sharing?" Ekatya threaded her fingers through Lhyn's. "Yes, but we've been talking, and we have an unusual request. You've always linked us together, but you've never Shared yourself." A chill ran down her spine. "It was never about me." "But it should be," Lhyn said.
