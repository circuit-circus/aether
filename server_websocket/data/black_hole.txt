A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light can escape from inside it.
In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe.
Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings.
By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses may form.
