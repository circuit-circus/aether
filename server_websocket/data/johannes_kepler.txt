I much prefer the sharpest criticism of a single intelligent man to the thoughtless approval of the masses. Truth is the daughter of time, and I feel no shame in being her midwife. Nature uses as little as possible of anything. I demonstrate by means of philosophy that the earth is round, and is inhabited on all sides; that it is insignificantly small, and is borne through the stars.
