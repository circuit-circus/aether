You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him find it within himself. All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover them. Measure what is measurable, and make measurable what is not so. If I were again beginning my studies, I would follow the advice of Plato and start with mathematics. I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use. Wine is sunlight, held together by water. Mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe. In questions of science, the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual. The sun, with all those planets revolving around it and dependent on it, can still ripen a bunch of grapes as if it had nothing else in the universe to do. I have never met a man so ignorant that I couldn't learn something from him.
