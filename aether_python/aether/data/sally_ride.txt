Science is fun. Science is curiosity. We all have natural curiosity. Science is a process of investigating. It's posing questions and coming up with a method. It's delving in.I think it's important for little girls growing up, and young women, to have one in every walk of life. So from that point of view, I'm proud to be a role model! When you're getting ready to launch into space, you're sitting on a big explosion waiting to happen. The stars don't look bigger, but they do look brighter. For whatever reason, I didn't succumb to the stereotype that science wasn't for girls. I got encouragement from my parents. I never ran into a teacher or a counselor who told me that science was for boys. A lot of my friends did. For a long time, society put obstacles in the way of women who wanted to enter the sciences. The astronauts who came in with me in my astronaut class - my class had 29 men and 6 women - those men were all very used to working with women. The fact that I was going to be the first American woman to go into space carried huge expectations along with it. When the space shuttle's engines cut off, and you're finally in space, in orbit, weightless... I remember unstrapping from my seat, floating over to the window, and that's when I got my first view of Earth. Just a spectacular view, and a chance to see our planet as a planet. My parents must have done a great job. Anytime I wanted to pursue something that they weren't familiar with, that was not part of their lifestyle, they let me go ahead and do it. The experience of being in space didn't change my perspective of myself or of the planet or of life. I had no spiritual experience. I've discovered that half the people would love to go into space and there's no need to explain it to them. The other half can't understand and I couldn't explain it to them. If someone doesn't know why, I can't explain it.
