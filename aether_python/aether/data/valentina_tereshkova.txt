A bird cannot fly with one wing only. Human space flight cannot develop any further without the active participation of women.
It doesn't matter what country or what political system you are from. Space brings you together.
One cannot deny the great role women have played in the world community. My flight was yet another impetus to continue this female contribution.
If women can be railroad workers in Russia, why can't they fly in space?
Once you've been in space, you appreciate how small and fragile the Earth is.
You don't think about the danger. The spaceship becomes your home.
Anyone who has spent any time in space will love it for the rest of their lives. I achieved my childhood dream of the sky.
